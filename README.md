# Bank Statement Converter - Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the bank statement converter application to fix caching issues, improve PDF processing for bank statements, and implement a full window PDF display feature.

## 1. Caching Issues Fixed

### Problem
The application was experiencing caching issues where old PDF files were being displayed instead of newly uploaded ones. This was caused by the view API route setting a long-term cache control header that cached PDFs for a year.

### Solution
Modified the view API route (`app/api/view/route.js`) to prevent long-term caching by changing the Cache-Control header from:
```
"Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```
to:
```
"Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate",
"Pragma": "no-cache",
"Expires": "0"
```

## 2. PDF Processing Improvements for Bank Statements

### Problem
The PDF processing logic was not optimally handling bank statements, resulting in poor conversion to columns and rows.

### Solution
Made several improvements to the `components/InspectClient.jsx` file:

1. Increased `longLineChars` and `longLineTokens` values to better handle longer lines in bank statements
2. Made the row clustering algorithm more lenient for bank statements by increasing the threshold
3. Reduced the penalty for uneven column distribution to better handle bank statements with varying column widths
4. Reduced the minimum column width to better accommodate narrow columns in bank statements

These changes improve the smart detection algorithm's ability to properly identify and extract table data from bank statements.

## 3. Full Window PDF Display Feature

### Problem
The application lacked a full window PDF display feature similar to bankstatementconverter.com.

### Solution
Implemented a full window PDF display feature by:

1. Creating a new `app/fullview` directory with a `page.jsx` component
2. Adding a `fullWindow` prop to the `InspectClient` component to enable full window display mode
3. Modifying the `InspectClient` component to render in full window mode when the `fullWindow` prop is true

The full window display provides an immersive experience for viewing and interacting with PDF documents, similar to the bankstatementconverter.com website.

## Testing

To test these improvements:

1. Upload a bank statement PDF file
2. Verify that the new file is displayed immediately without caching issues
3. Check that the bank statement is properly converted to columns and rows
4. Navigate to `/fullview?uuid=[UUID]` to view the PDF in full window mode

## Conclusion

These improvements address the caching issues, enhance the PDF processing for bank statements, and provide a full window display feature that enhances the user experience when working with bank statement PDFs.
